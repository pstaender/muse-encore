# muse-encore-viewer

Show MuseScore files (`.mscz`/`.mscx`) in a web page, like an inline PDF viewer: the pages as MuseScore Studio lays
them out, MuseScore's continuous views, zoom, printing (vector pages), full screen and playback. MusicXML
(`.musicxml`/`.xml`/`.mxl`), MIDI (`.mid`/`.midi`/`.kar`), Capella (`.cap`/`.capx`), Guitar Pro
(`.gtp`/`.gp3`/`.gp4`/`.gp5`/`.gpx`/`.gp`) and Power Tab (`.ptb`) files are imported like MuseScore Studio's File > Open.

It is based on [MuseEncore](https://github.com/pstaender/muse-encore), a TypeScript port of MuseScore Studio's
engraving engine (reference version 4.7.5). Everything runs in the browser; no server is needed.

## Usage

With a bundler:

```sh
npm install muse-encore-viewer
```

```js
import applyMuseEncoreViewer from 'muse-encore-viewer'

applyMuseEncoreViewer(document.getElementById('score'), 'scores/example.mscz')
```

From a CDN, without a build step:

```html
<div id="score" style="aspect-ratio: 3/4; width: 100%; height: auto;"></div>
<script type="module">
    import applyMuseEncoreViewer from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/muse-encore-viewer@latest/dist/muse-encore-viewer.js'

    applyMuseEncoreViewer('#score', 'scores/example.mscz', { toolbarGroups: { playback: true } })
</script>
```

The viewer fills the element, so give the element a height. Its controls live in a shadow root: the page's styles
do not change them and their styles do not leak into the page. Several viewers can be on one page.

The score is loaded with `fetch`, so a score on another host must allow cross-origin requests. Instead of a URL you can
pass the file's data (`ArrayBuffer`, `Uint8Array`) or a `File`/`Blob`.

## Options

All options with their defaults:

```js
const viewer = applyMuseEncoreViewer(targetElement, pathToMuseScoreFile, {
    centerAndResizeToPage: 1,     // fit this page (1-based) into the view and center it; false: start at the top
    zoom: 'whole-page',           // or 'page-width' or a percentage (100 with centerAndResizeToPage: false)
    continuousView: false,        // 'horizontal', 'vertical', 'window-fit'; false: the page view
    pageOrientation: 'horizontal',// the pages of the page view side by side, or 'vertical'
    twoPages: false,              // facing pages, odd page numbers on the right
    toolbarGroups: {
        pageNavigation: true,     // previous / next page, page indicator
        pageView: true,           // view mode (page / continuous views) and page layout
        zoom: true,               // zoom in / out, zoom levels, center measure
        playback: false,          // play / pause, rewind, play position
        print: true,              // print button
        fullScreen: true,         // full screen button
        file: false,              // open / close a file, file name, dropping files
    },
    keyboardShortcuts: false,     // MuseScore's shortcuts while the viewer has the focus, and the "?" button
    disableToolbar: false,        // no toolbar at all
    showStatusBar: false,         // the status bar below the score
    colorScheme: 'auto',          // 'light', 'dark'; auto: the browser's
    fontsUrl: undefined,          // the fonts directory; default: this package's fonts/ next to dist/
    soundFontUrl: undefined,      // MS Basic.sf3; default: MuseScore's repository (see Playback)
    onLoad: (info) => {},         // { fileName, title, pageCount }
    onError: (error) => {},
})
```

The continuous views are MuseScore's continuous view (horizontal: one long system; vertical: all systems on one long
page). `'window-fit'` (not in MuseScore) lays the score out as wide as the view, without system and page breaks, and
again when the view's size or the zoom changes.

Browsers without the Fullscreen API for elements (Safari on the iPhone) get a full screen button too: the viewer then
fills the browser window instead of the screen, so the browser's own bars stay visible.

## The viewer object

```js
await viewer.ready                 // { fileName, title, pageCount } when the score is shown
await viewer.load('other.mscz')    // another score
await viewer.load(blob, 'song.musicxml') // the file name's suffix selects the format
viewer.pageCount()
viewer.currentPage()               // 1-based
viewer.goToPage(3)
viewer.centerAndResizeToPage(2)
viewer.setZoom(150)                // or 'whole-page', 'page-width'
viewer.setContinuousView('window-fit') // or 'horizontal', 'vertical', false
await viewer.play()                // call it from a user gesture (the browser's autoplay rules)
viewer.pause()
viewer.stop()                      // back to the start
viewer.isPlaying()
await viewer.print()
viewer.toggleFullScreen()
viewer.destroy()
```

## Playback

The playback uses MuseScore's MIDI renderer and MuseScore's soundfont "MS Basic.sf3" (MIT license, 51 MB) with the
[SpessaSynth](https://github.com/spessasus/spessasynth_lib) synthesizer. The soundfont is downloaded on the first
playback and kept in the browser's Cache Storage. By default it is loaded from MuseScore's repository at the
reference version (raw.githubusercontent.com); set `soundFontUrl` to serve it yourself.

## Playalong and MIDI input

With `toolbarGroups: { playalong: true }` the toolbar has the Playalong button: it follows the score measure by measure
while the user plays, and highlights the measure. It starts at the paused play position. The notes come from a MIDI
device if the MIDI input is on (the MIDI settings button: "Enable MIDI input", the device; the browser asks for
permission, Safari has no Web MIDI) and otherwise from the microphone (Spotify's
[basic-pitch](https://github.com/spotify/basic-pitch), Apache-2.0, running in a Web Worker). The model and the
detection are loaded on the first start. The model is in `basic-pitch/` next to `dist/`; if you copy only the module,
copy it too and set `noteDetectionUrl`. The browser needs a secure context (HTTPS) for the microphone and for MIDI.

## Fonts

The engraving fonts (Leland, Bravura, Edwin, ... with their licenses) are in `fonts/` and loaded at runtime from the
same place as the module (`../fonts/` relative to `dist/muse-encore-viewer.js`), which works with CDNs that serve the
whole package (jsDelivr, unpkg). If you copy only the module, copy the fonts too and set `fontsUrl`.

## License

GPL-3.0-only, like MuseScore Studio. The fonts have their own licenses (see `fonts/`).

## Building

In the repository: `npm run build:viewer-package` builds this package into `packages/viewer` (the module, its
type declarations, the fonts and the license); then `npm publish` there. `packages/viewer/example/` shows a few
viewers on a page and a configurator of the options (`npx vite packages/viewer`, then open `/example/?url=<score>`); it is online at
[pstaender.github.io/muse-encore/viewer-package/example/](https://pstaender.github.io/muse-encore/viewer-package/example/).
